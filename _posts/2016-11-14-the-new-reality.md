It’s setting in. This morning I awoke to the news of Trump’s appointment of Stephen Bannon and the vandalism in NYC of swastikas sprawled on sidewalks and dorm room doors. Is this what America is really like?

I think not. I refuse to believe that most of this country’s citizens, regardless of whom they voted for, think this type of hatred and discrimination is acceptable.

I watched this past weekend as anti-Trump protests continued across the country. And while I admire the passion, I’m beginning to wonder what the next constructive step is. Emotion is not enough. Fighting *against* something just doesn’t affect change the way fighting *for* something does.

Americans marched *for a woman’s right to vote*. We marched *for civil rights*. We must determine the concrete changes are we marching for-and fast.

The peaceful transfer of power is one of the most amazing features of our democracy. So, I don’t feel it’s productive to fight against this peaceful transition. That’s not to say that I agree with what I’m seeing shape up in this transitionary time. Rather I’m asking for what specifically we want as Americans. Do we want to impeach Trump? Are we outraged at the fact that a man who has broken laws is now sitting in the highest office? Do we want to to make it clear to our elected officials in the Senate that what is going on right now will not stand? Do we want to shut down the government with a physical DOS attack? I mean literally overwhelming the House and Senate representatives in Congress with phone calls letters and personal visits so that they cannot go about their daily lives until they listen.

There is much we need to do together. What do you think we need to unite around and fight for?
