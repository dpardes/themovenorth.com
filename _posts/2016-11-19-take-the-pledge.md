This has been a tough week. I watched along with world as President-Elect Trump built the inner circle of his administration. If you’ve sequestered yourself from media this week, [take a look here](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/11/18/who-has-trump-appointed-his-cabinet-so-far/94075950/) to see the “progress.” There is so much that’s troubling, not least of which is the lack of diversity in ANY respect. And just for the record, these guys (yup, all guys) are the old establishment, career politicians — so much for “draining the swamp.”

In particular, I want to highlight that our new National Security Advisor, Mike Flynn, [has called Islam “a cancer”](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/11/18/who-has-trump-appointed-his-cabinet-so-far/94075950/) and [tweeted that a fear of Muslims is rational](https://twitter.com/GenFlynn/status/703387702998278144). In reaction to this, a colleague at [SYPartners](https://www.sypartners.com/about/) created [this brilliant site](https://www.registerus.today) that’d I’d encourage you to check and take the pledge. If you need convincing, Martin Niemöller can do it better than I.
