Friday night, while I lit Shabbat candles with my wife and children, this was a few blocks away:

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_55" style="width: 300px">![Adam Yauch Park desecrated with Swastikas](http://themovenorth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/adam-yauch-desicration-300x284.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-55">Adam Yauch Park desecrated with Swastikas</figcaption></figure>Yes, those are swastikas. And they were scrawled on a children’s playground a few blocks from my apartment. Thank goodness that the [amazing community here in Brooklyn (including the remaining Beastie Boys) rose up to condemn this stupidity and stand together against hate](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/11/19/502710608/swastikas-are-painted-at-adam-yauch-park-in-nyc-but-kids-win-the-day).

I’m not sure how to describe what I’ve been feeling. There is of course the realization that this isn’t happening “somewhere;” this is happening HERE. However, I think what has hit me harder is the realization that our President-Elect has taken the time to criticize the behavior of the cast of Hamilton for trying to speak with Mike Pence.

See that? He said they should apologize “for their terrible behavior”. I think that’s stupid because they were incredibly respectful and their behavior is what we, as Americans, should aspire to emulate. But I digress. The upsetting part is that Trump hasn’t tweeted anything about the swastikas in Brooklyn Heights drawn in his name. He hasn’t tweeted any condemnation of the multiple acts of hate and discrimination around our country that have been on the rise since his election.

I have been trying to keep an open mind towards the Trump administration. But with the recent appointments (more on that [here](http://themovenorth.com/2016/11/take-the-pledge/) and [here](http://themovenorth.com/2016/11/the-new-reality/)) and his constant failures to stand for what is obviously right, my patience and conscience are wearing thin. And because writing this all down isn’t enough, I’m committing to double my donations to the great organizations that John Oliver [recommended on his amazing show](https://twitter.com/LastWeekTonight): Last Week Tonight.
