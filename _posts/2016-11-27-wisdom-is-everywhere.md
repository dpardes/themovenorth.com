I just spent the Thanksgiving holiday in Ohio ([go Buckeyes!](http://www.cleveland.com/osu/index.ssf/2016/11/who_won_the_ohio_state_michiga.html)) surrounded by family from New York, Ohio, and Tennessee. I must admit that there wasn’t any awkward political conversation. Actually, it was the opposite. What I heard was deep concern for our country and its people. It was amazing.

I’ll admit that most of the folks I spoke with are as scared of Donald Trump as I am. However, we mostly chatted about how much we love this country and how much we value its diverse populous.

On my way to the airport, in the garage, I passed a beer koozie that along with a picture of our capitol said the following

> Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups

So, my reverie was ended. Around the same time I heard about the Clinton campaign getting involved in the recounts of some battleground states. Sigh… I understand why we must make sure what happened is real, but I really don’t know how long we can deal with this he-said, she-said. Can’t we all unite under the banner that our system is clearly broken? Here’s hoping I can be thankful for a major change by next November.
