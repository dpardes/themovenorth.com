I remember the shock of post 9/11 NYC. I also remember that I smiled the moment I saw [The Onion’s “Holy Fucking Shit” Issue](http://www.theonion.com/article/american-life-turns-into-bad-jerry-bruckheimer-mov-220).

To keep things in perspective, a peaceful election is *not even close* to the same type of devastating event as the attacks in 2001. However, the numbness and fear afterwards did feel similar.

So again, I turn to The Onion.
