TheMoveNorth.com was purchased as a joke. I was joking about moving to Canada if Donald Trump won the 2016 election.

Now that Donald Trump is our President Elect, I realize that moving to Canada is just that…a joke. I am not going anywhere.

I LOVE this country. It is my responsibility to make the United States of America a better place for ALL of us to live, together. And so, I plan to use TheMoveNorth.com to help tell the story of how I’m doing that.
